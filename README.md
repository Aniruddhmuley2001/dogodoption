# Dogodoption
This is an application to adopt animals like cat, dog, birds etc. Presently, it is only restricted to areas of California and Seattle, due to the API available.

## Tech Stack
I have used React in developing the application. Also, React Hooks, Context API and Parcel have been used. The API implemented is Pet API, to get information on the animal types and their respective breeds.

## Running the file
After cloning the file, open the terminal and run the following commands: <br/>
<addr>
  `npm install` <br/>
  `npm run start`
</addr>
